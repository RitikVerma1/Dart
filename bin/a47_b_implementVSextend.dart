Difference Between implements and extends in Dart

1. extends (Inheritance)
When a class extends another class, it inherits all properties and methods of the parent class.
The child class can use the parentâ€™s methods directly without implementing them.
The child class can override methods to change their behavior.
A class can only extend one class (no multiple inheritance).


2. implements (Interface Implementation)
When a class implements another class, it does not inherit its methods.
The class must override all methods from the implemented class.
This is useful when you want a class to act as an interface.
A class can implement multiple classes.
