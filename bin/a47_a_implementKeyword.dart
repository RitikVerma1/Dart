/* (interface = contract/rules  &  abstract = Blue Print)
When a class implements another class, it does not inherit its methods. it must ovveride all methods

In Dart, an interface is a way to define a contract(rules or expectations that class must follow) that classes can implement.
 Unlike other languages like Java, Dart does not have a separate interface keyword. 
 Instead, every class in Dart can act as an interface that other classes can implement.

How Interfaces Work in Dart:
A class can be used as an interface by another class using the implements keyword.
When a class implements another class, it must override all the methods and properties of that class.
Dart does not support multiple inheritance, but a class can implement multiple interfaces.


The implements keyword is used when a class needs to follow the structure of another class (or interface(abstract class)) 
but does not inherit any behavior.

Explanation:
Animal is an abstract class with a method makeSound(), but no body.
Dog and Cat classes use implements Animal:
They must override the makeSound() method.
They do not inherit behavior, only the method structure.

Why Use implements?
âœ… Ensures every class follows a specific structure.
âœ… Allows multiple classes to follow the same contract(method or something that classes must have) but implement their own logic.
âœ… Encourages clean, modular code.

This is useful when you want different objects to behave in a standardized way but with unique implementations. ðŸš€

void main() {
  Dog dog = Dog();
  Cat cat = Cat();

  dog.makeSound(); // Calls Dog's version of makeSound()
  cat.makeSound(); // Calls Cat's version of makeSound()
}

// This is an interface (abstract class can be used as interface)
//abstract means is not concrete, not fully defined, or incomplete on its own.
// an abstract class is a blueprint for other classes.
//It cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be extended (inherited) by other classes.
abstract class Animal {
  void makeSound(); // Method without a body (must be overridden)
}

// Dog class implements Animal
//When a class implements another class, it does not inherit its methods. it must ovveride all methods

class Dog implements Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Woof! Woof!"); // Dog's implementation
  }
}

// Cat class implements Animal
class Cat implements Animal {
  @override
  void makeSound() {
    print("Meow! Meow!"); // Cat's implementation
  }
}
